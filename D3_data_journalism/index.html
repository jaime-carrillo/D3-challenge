          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on the data provided, there seems to be a correlation between poverty and lack of healthcare. 
            States with a higher proportion of people in poverty also tend to have a higher percentage of persons lacking healthcare.  
            Similarly, states with higher proportion of patients in poverty tend to have higher percentages of tobacco use and obesity.</p>

          <p>The median age for all states ranges from 30 to 45 years old; a relatively young crowd. 
            The data seems to indicate that the older the population is, the greater the access to healthcare may be.
            Older age appears to have an effect on the proportion of people smoking, 
            but age has no correlation to the percentage of obesity in the United States.</p>

          <p>Proportionally, states with lower median household incomes, also have higher percentages of their population lacking healthcare.
            However, this tendency stops at a household income of about $55,000. Greater median household income appears to influence the likelihood of smoking.
            Whereas; higher household income has an inverse correlation to the proportion of obesity, 
            meaning, states with higher median household income show lower percentanges of obesity in their populations.
